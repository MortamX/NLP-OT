# NLP-OT

This repository contains the work done during a research project with Paul Mortamet and guided by Dr. Fran√ßois Yvon.

The Notebook contains the final report and the code that we used to get our results and the changes that we tested.

## Abstract

There are few specific studies on
the use of Optimal Transport in
word alignment problems between
sentences in different languages (Word
Alignment). Our study follows the work of
